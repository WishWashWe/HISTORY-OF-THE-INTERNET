## Article Summary:
-   This article:
	    -   (1) Explains the Importance and Origin of the Dewey Decimal System
	    -   (2) Scopes out the contraversy surrounding the categorization system and displays the arguments stated by previous library scholars.
	    -  (3) Impartially looks into the life of Dewey and his work to cocur wether his system was in fact his or a prospect of plagerism. 
##### About Melvil Dewey
- The article displays that While Melvil Dewey certainly did not invent his decimal scheme out of whole cloth, but he did craft its pattern by selecting the threads from which its essential fabric was woven. For the most part these threads came from two locations, The St. Louis Public School Library classification system & Amherst College.
		- Dewey's genius was in weaving them into a simple system most libraries could easily adopt. His good fortune was that he presented it at the beginning of a public library movement in the United States that significantly benefited from a common classification scheme, and since in the twentieth century, the American public library became a model other countries emulated, worldwide adoption of Dewey's scheme followed easily.
 His legacy, however, is mixed. On the one hand, the scheme has over the decades saved millions of dollars and countless hours of time. Because it has become so widely accepted throughout the world it has permitted one person to classify one title for the hundreds of thousands of libraries using the decimal system. In addition, the system itself has become familiar to millions of people who can feel relatively confident that their knowledge of the system used in one library will serve them well in another. On the other hand, the doctrine of Anglo-Saxonism Dewey wove so tightly into his system has over the years resisted the introduction of new threads with more culturally pluralistic origins


## Key Takeaways 
##### What is the Dewey Decimal Classification System?
It is a proprietary library classification system which allows new books to be added to a library in their appropriate location based on the subject. It was first published in the United States by Melvil Dewey in 1876
	- By 1996- around over 200,000 libraries in 135 countries were using the classification to organize their collections. In the United States alone, it was being used by 95 percent of public and school libraries, 25 percent of special libraries, and 25 percent of academic libraries


##### Why is Dewey's Classification Scheme so controversial?
***Although a debate about the origins of the Dewey Decimal Classification Scheme has been going on for generations, the historical consensus remains elusive. Why?
-   Reasons for a lack of consensus are not hard to find. Dewey himself established some parameters by dropping inconsistent hints during his lifetime and scattering inconclusive bits of information throughout his publications.
	- In a 1920 Library Journal article entitled "Decimal Classification Beginnings," for example, he described the moment of inspiration for the scheme in 1873. in the simplified form of spelling, Dewey used variously throughout his life are explained. However, Despite its wide circulation, however, the article fails to clarify the classification's origins.
    -   Dewey did acknowledge a debt to Sir Francis Bacon (who nearly three centuries earlier had hypothesized that all knowledge derived from memory, reason, and imagination and that these three invariably produced works of history, philosophy, and belles lettres), but he failed to locate his scheme in the continuum of library classification history and thus generally ignored the contributions and influences of his predecessors.
    -   Ever since library historians have been trying to clarify and contextualize the classification's origins. Strongly believing that Dewey did not create a decimal classification, and for the past half-century the historiography addressing its origins has tried to identify debts Dewey owed predecessors and contemporaries in classification history that he at one time or another acknowledged, overlooked, forgot, allegedly even deliberately ignored. **(This phenomena has earned the name the Dewey Debate) 

#### THE DEWEY DEBATE 
Aruments given by series of library historians have been trying to clarify and contextualize the classification's origins.
###### Kurt F. Leidecker
- The debate was initiated in 1945 by **Kurt F. Leidecker. *******In the course of researching a biography of William Torrey Harris in the early 1940s. As Dewey had settled on a basic outline for his scheme, he still sought outside advice, especially for the identification of appropriate classes. On 9 May he wrote to William T. Harris for more information on his classification scheme. Harris responded four days later. "Perhaps the main advantages of my scheme are my plan of numbering such classes and the ease with which one masters the details after getting a glimpse of the general plan,"


##### Eugene E. Graziano
- The next contributor to the debate was Eugene E. Graziano, who had read Leidecker's biography of Harris. Because Dewey had adapted so heavily from Harris, and because Harris had studied the philosophy of G. W. F. Hegel, Graziano concluded that Hegel's philosophy, whether Dewey knew it or not, constituted the philosophical foundation on which the Decimal Classification ultimately was based.


##### John Maass
- John Maass, had another opinion, While doing research on the United States Centennial Exhibition of 1876 in Philadelphia. Maass studied William Phipps Blake, a geologist and mining engineer whom the Centennial Commission had engaged in 1872 to organize its exhibition. On 25 May 1872, Maass notes, Blake submitted a scheme to the commission that organized the exhibition into ten "departments," each of which was subdivided into ten "groups," each of which was further divided into ten "classes." Maass notes that Blake's classification was published as a leaflet in February 1873 and likely was sent to Amherst. He also notes that a forty-two-page pamphlet elaborating the scheme was "mailed to professional men throughout the U.S." a month later. Based on this evidence, Maass argues that "Dewey copied that decimal notation from Blake . . . and cunningly covered his tracks."

##### John Comaromi's
- The most recent and most thoroughly researched entry into the historiographical debate surrounding the origins of the scheme is **John Comaromi's** book, The Eighteen Editions of the Dewey Decimal Classification (1976), which many scholars regard as the most definitive work so far on the subject. In his first chapter Comaromi evaluates arguments made by Leidecker, Graziano, and Maass, but for additional clues he also an analyzes the preface to Dewey's first edition of the DDC, the ideas of other classification experts like Leo LaMontagne, W. C. Berwick Sayers, and Henry Evelyn Bliss.

-   Comaromi judges the evidence Maass presents for his thesis "inconclusive," but finds Leidecker and Graziano's arguments highly plausible. He acknowledges Dewey probably drew on strong points from the classification schemes of Harris and Schwartz, the former because he used Arabic numerals for classes (and within classes arranged materials alphabetically by author surname), the latter because he used Arabic numerals for first and all subsequent divisions beyond the major classes to which he assigned numbers. Comaromi also acknowledges that Hegel's philosophy constituted the theoretical basis for Harris's system, and be cause Harris's system was "the most fruitful source of Dewey's conception," he concludes, Hegel "provided the philosophical underpinnings" of Dewey's system
